What Does the state Field Mean in Kratos?
The state field describes the current status of the user's identity in Kratos. It helps you control account access and manage lifecycle states. The possible values are:

"active": The user can authenticate and access the system normally.
"inactive": The user is registered but not allowed to log in (often used before verification).
"recovery": The user is in the process of recovering their account (like a password reset).
"disabled": The account is disabled and cannot be used for login.
